# Project

## Rough points

* A visual representation of data
* Ability to label days with 'tags'
* Ability to go more in depth on specific days
* Ability to attach 'markers' to periods of time or a day (eg... sleep time, meditation time, food intake, period cycle), these would be able to find correlations between mood & influences in life ✓
* A focus on concise, simple and fast journalling so it's easily achieved in under 5 minutes with not much effort or thought. This can turn it from a chore into a sustainable practice ✓

## Initial steps

* Map out potential database tables and relationships ✓
* Create and populate test and seed database ✓
* Rough plan of how data calculation will be achieved ✓
* Solidify all routes and get some basic styling/templates up! ✓
* Collect some input from friends/family to refine plan before starting the coding ✓
